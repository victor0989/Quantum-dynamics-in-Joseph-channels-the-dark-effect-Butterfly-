Quantum dynamics in Jospeph channels. (From Ioseph, the Latin form of Greek Ἰωσήφ (Ioseph), which was from the Hebrew name יוֹסֵף (Yosef) meaning "he will add", from the root יָסַף (yasaf) meaning "to add, to increase")

*This diagram of Cauchy domains represents the causal sets within specific regions of spacetime, essential for studying quantum dynamics in complex systems like Josephson junctions and the dark effect.*

Causal sets The chronological future I+(Q) (chronological past I−(Q)) of a set Q is the set of points for
each of which there is a past-directed (future-directed) time-like curve that intersects Q. The curve xμ(λ) is said to be causal (or non-space-like) if its tangent vector uμ = dxμ/dλ
obeys the condition uμ uμ ≤ 0 at each of its points. A non-space-like (causal) curve between two points, which is not a null geodesic, can be deformed into a time-like curve connecting
these points. The causal future J+(Q) (causal past J−(Q)) of a set Q is the set of points for each of which there is a past-directed (future-directed) causal curve that intersects Q. The future
Cauchy domain D+(Q) (past Cauchy domain D−(Q)) of a set Q is the set of points such that any past-directed (future-directed) causal curve passing through it intersects Q)

A surface  is called space-like, time-like, or null, if its normal vector is time-like, space-
like, or null, respectively.4 A global Cauchy surface in a spacetime M is a non-time-like hypersurface that is intersected by each causal curve exactly once.
