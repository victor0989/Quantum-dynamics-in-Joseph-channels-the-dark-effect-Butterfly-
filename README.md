# Quantum-dynamics-in-Joseph-channels-the-dark-effect-Butterfly-
Quantum dynamics in Jospeph channels. 
Meaning: (From Ioseph, the Latin form of Greek Ἰωσήφ (Ioseph), which was from the Hebrew name יוֹסֵף (Yosef) meaning "he will add", from the root יָסַף (yasaf) meaning "to add, to increase")

*The dark butterfly symbolizes the potential decline and death of relativity theory (space-time projections) and represents the disruption and elimination of time and space as primary components. This symbol directs the focus of research toward exploring higher-dimensional spaces in the universe and quantum circuits.*


# Classical systems & Lyapunov exponent(Dark-Butterfly)
In a classical chaotic system, a small perturbation in initial conditions leads to an exponential divergence of trajectories, z(t) e clt z(0) . Here, one mathematical variable z denotes the distance between two
trajectories in a phase space with respect to a norm ,and the positive real number cl is called the maximal Lyapunov exponent. (Butterfly effect explores the possibility of Quantum Chaos in other topological spaces and in the context of black holes in physics and Joseph channels and Junctions. These are descriptions for circuit and channels-bus circuitry and circuitry topology studies based on diferent researches.

*This diagram of Cauchy domains represents the causal sets within specific regions of spacetime, essential for studying quantum dynamics in complex systems like Josephson junctions and the dark effect.*

Causal sets The chronological future I+(Q) (chronological past I−(Q)) of a set Q is the set of points for
each of which there is a past-directed (future-directed) time-like curve that intersects Q. The curve xμ(λ) is said to be causal (or non-space-like) if its tangent vector uμ = dxμ/dλ
obeys the condition uμ uμ ≤ 0 at each of its points. A non-space-like (causal) curve between two points, which is not a null geodesic, can be deformed into a time-like curve connecting
these points. The causal future J+(Q) (causal past J−(Q)) of a set Q is the set of points for each of which there is a past-directed (future-directed) causal curve that intersects Q. The future
Cauchy domain D+(Q) (past Cauchy domain D−(Q)) of a set Q is the set of points such that any past-directed (future-directed) causal curve passing through it intersects Q)

A surface  is called space-like, time-like, or null, if its normal vector is time-like, space-
like, or null, respectively.4 A global Cauchy surface in a spacetime M is a non-time-like hypersurface that is intersected by each causal curve exactly once.
